This Location contains practices on Proprocessor in C

C programs are compiled in four exclusive Steps:
Pre-processing Stage -> Compiling Stage -> Assembing Stage -> Linking Stage

Preprocessing is facilitated by macros in the source code: preprocessor directives

Preprocessor directives:
	Includes files and code
	Replace tokens
	Facilitate conditional compilation
